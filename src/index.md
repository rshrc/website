## About this page

This page consists of only two resources: the HTML and the picture.  
The ‘appearing’ effect is achieved using the CSS `keyframes` feature, orchestrated by a compile-time Dart script.

This site is based on [Filiph Hráček](https://github.com/filiph)'s original work on [filiph/filiphnet](https://github.com/filiph/filiphnet), a minimalist, Markdown-first personal site generator.  
I've forked and extended it with my own customizations — but the core elegance of the setup is very much thanks to Filiph's original vision and engineering.
